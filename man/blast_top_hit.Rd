\arguments{
\item{query}{(Required) Query sequence. Accepts a DNABin object, DNAStringSet object, Character string, or filepath.}

\item{db}{(Required) Reference sequences to conduct search against. Accepts a DNABin object, DNAStringSet object, Character string, or filepath.
If DNAbin, DNAStringSet or character string is provided, a temporary fasta file is used to construct BLAST database}

\item{type}{(Required) type of search to conduct, default 'blastn'}

\item{identity}{(Required) Minimum percent identity cutoff. Note that this is calculated using all alignments for each query-subject match.}

\item{coverage}{(Required) Minimum percent query coverage cutoff. Note that this is calculated using all alignments for each query-subject match.}

\item{evalue}{(Required) Minimum expect value (E) for saving hits}

\item{max_target_seqs}{(Required) Number of aligned sequences to keep. Even if you are only looking for 1 top hit keep this higher for calculations to perform properly.}

\item{max_hsp}{(Required) Maximum number of HSPs (alignments) to keep for any single query-subject pair.}

\item{ranks}{(Required) The taxonomic ranks contained in the fasta headers}

\item{delim}{(Required) The delimiter between taxonomic ranks in fasta headers}

\item{args}{(Optional) Extra arguments passed to BLAST}

\item{remove_db_gaps}{Whether gaps should be removed from the fasta file used for the database. Note that makeblastdb can fail if there are too many gaps in the sequence.}

\item{quiet}{(Optional) Whether progress should be printed to console, default is FALSE}

\item{tie}{How to handle ties in top hit results. Options are to break ties by selecting the first hit (Default), or return all tied hits.}
